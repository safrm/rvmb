description: Rapid VM builder for qemu-kvm based portable VMs

Base use cases: 
A. Portable VMs - can be run from usb drive or just copied (2 files) between 2 computers
   (rvmb does not have to be even installed)
B. Rapid installation - there is no need to have anything (default targets or 
   own target file) to recreate standard VMs quickly and repetitavely
C. VM backing up - VM image can be zipped and restored by just copying one file 
   (6,4GB disk compressed to 1,3GB), QCOW2 images can also use qemu snapshots
D. Clonning environments - very easy clonning existing VM into the same environments 
   - install once reuse image many times
E. CI intergations - possible to run and control without gui (from for example jenkins)

install.sh ............ installation (from source) script

Usage 1: Create and connect VM:
#check available targets 
$ rvmb list-targets

#create and install VM
#there can be passed own configuration file based on teplate (-t <file>)
#or created clone of the same VM configuration (-c <number>)
$ rvmb install ubuntu-12.04-i386-desktop

#.. manual steps during installation

#running the VM
$ rvmb start ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386

#connect running VM
$ rvmb connect-ssh ubuntu-12.04-i386-desktop


Usage 2:Try live iso :
$ rvmb run-live-iso ubuntu-12.04-x86_64-desktop


Usage 3: Clone VM0 to VM1 and connect between 2 VMs :
Steps from Usage 1
rvmb start ubuntu-12.04-i386-desktop -c 1

#connect from VM0 to VM1 
rvmb connect-ssh ubuntu-12.04-i386-desktop
VM0$ ssh  192.168.101.2 -p 8024
#connect from VM1 to VM0 
rvmb connect-ssh ubuntu-12.04-i386-desktop -c 1
VM1$ ssh  192.168.101.2 -p 8023
